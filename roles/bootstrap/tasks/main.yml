# vim: set ft=yaml.ansible:
#
# This role aligns with the bare installation from my machine OS installation
# scripts (aka the bootstrap scripts).  It is here to ensure a baseline minimum
# below anything else being built or added on top with Ansible.  This could have
# been rolled into the "common" role, which all machines receive but I wanted to
# specifically provide a separation from what was done in bootstrap versus
# what I consider to be a "common" or default system setup.
#
# From a practical perspective, you should be able to install the OS on a machine
# using the bootstrap scripts and then run this Ansible role and NOTHING should
# change (or very little at any rate).  The end result here should simply be an
# "enforced" or "under management" version of a bootstrapped machine with nothing
# else added.
#
# The only noticeable part of the bootstrap that is not replicated here is user setup.
# I leave that to be done in the higher Ansible roles as it is more machine specific.
